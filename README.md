# burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

### Overview

The application is a burger logger that follows the MVC design paradigm with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. It uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, while using Handlebars for HTML templating.  

### Application Use

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
